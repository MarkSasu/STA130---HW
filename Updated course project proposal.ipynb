    "# Research Question 1: Gender Differences in Body Self-Image Scores\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question: Do men and women differ significantly in body self-image perceptions, specifically in height dissatisfaction and fatness evaluation scores?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "### DEMO_gender: This variable categorizes participants by gender, allowing for comparisons in body self-image across groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "### PSYCH_body_self_image_questionnaire_height_dissatisfaction_score and  PSYCH_body_self_image_questionnaire_fatness_evaluation_score: Measures of participants' dissatisfaction with their height and body fatness, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Method of Analysis: Independent t-tests to compare self-image scores between genders.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Procedure:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Check Normality (Visual Check): Plot a histogram of self-image scores for each gender. If the distribution looks roughly bell-shaped, the data is likely close enough to normal. Alternatively, use a boxplot to check for symmetry. If the boxplot is roughly symmetrical, it suggests the data may be approximately normal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Test Homogeneity of Variances: Use Levene’s test to check if variances are equal across gender groups. If not, use Welch’s t-test, which doesn’t assume equal variances.\n",

    "### Perform T-test: Run the t-test (or Welch’s t-test if variances are unequal) to see if there are statistically significant differences between gender groups.\n",

    "### Normality of self-image scores within each gender group (tested via Shapiro-Wilk).\n",

    "### Histogram for gender distribution to illustrate the sample’s gender composition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Boxplot of self-image scores by gender to visualize central tendencies and variability across genders.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hypothesis:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Research Hypothesis: Women will report higher dissatisfaction scores due to societal pressures on body image.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no significant difference in body self-image scores between men and women.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Results: If the research hypothesis holds, women will show significantly higher dissatisfaction scores than men, aligning with body image literature. This will answer whether gender impacts self-image in this sample."
