    "### 1.  A simple Linear regression is a method that medols the relationship between a single dependant variable (outcome) and the independant variable (predictor), where Y represents the dependant variable. X is the independant variable, B0 is the intercept and B1 is the slope of the line while Ïµ represents the error term. You may notice that this is similar to the equation of a tangent line, y = mx + b. On the contrary,  multiple linear regression is an extension of the simple linear regression that models the relationship in between multiple dependant and independant variables. A benefit of working with Multiple Linear Regression over Simple Linear Regression is Realistic Modeling. The benefit is as simple as it seems; real-world results are often influenced by a variety of factors, which is why Multiple linear regression is better equiped due to the fact that is is more applicable in complex analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. There are several difference that can be accounted for between the two linear forms. Firstly, the nature of the relationship, the difference in between the two is that a continuous variable represents a gradient relationship, where the change in the outcome variable is proportional to the change in the input variable. In an indicator variable, the relationship between the outcome and input variable represents a shift in the mean value of the outcome variable between two categories, not exactly a continuous change. Another difference is the graphical representation, a continous variable results in a continous line graph that is uninterupted mean while for the indicator variable, the coefficient B1 shows the difference between the different Y va;ues from the two groups represented by the indicator variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. The simple linear regression provides a single intepretation of how the dependant variable differentiates as the independant variables changes. There are no outside factors or specific effects that are being considered when using simple linear regression. Therefore, any factor influencing Y must be only shown in X alone. For a multiple linear regression with continuous and indicator variables, when an indicator, let's say D is introduced. The model is able to differentiate different subgroups of the model and return knowledge on how Y is infleunced across these different groups. B1 still represents the effect of the continuous variable X on Y, but now the effect is considered within the context of specific categories defined by D. B2 represents the difference in intercepts between the two categories defined by D. For instance, if D represents gender, B2 quantifies how the average salary differs between genders when controlling for years of experience. You may ask: What is the benefit of moving from SLR to MLR. Well, the incllusion of multiple predictors; what this means is the MLR allows for a more comprehensive modeling by incorporating muktple predictors, enabling for a more accurate and overall explanations of the dependant variable (Y).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Adding an interaction between a continuous and an indicator variable in a Multiple Linear Regression Model allows the model to capture how the effect of the continuous variable on the dependant variable Y changes depending on the cateogry defined by the indicator. This is because adding an interaction term makes the model more flexible and capable of modeling complex relationships. There are several key points of adding an interaction term though, firstly, there are different slpos. If the interaction term is significant, it indicates that the effect of x on y changes between categories. Furthermore, it provides enhanced insight, it represents a deeper understanding of how different factors work together to affect the outcome, making the model better at representing real-world scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. A multiple linear regression model using only indicator variable from a non-binary categorical variable models differences in the dependant variable Y across categories. It does by using dummy variable encoding, where each category is represented by a binary variables. The model compares mean outcomes across categories, not trends, and adjusts the intercepts for each cateogry based on dummy variable values. \n",

    "### 1. Additive model ( without interaction): Y = B0 + B1X1 + B2X2, the predictors' effects are independant and additive. The change in Y due to X1, dosen't depend on X2 and vice versa. With the interaction, the formula is Y = B0 + B1X1 + B2X2 + B3(X1 x X2). There are two prediction steps for this. The first one is we substitude values for X1 and X2 and then calculate the product for the two, then we multiplpy each X1 and X2 by their respective coefficient. The impact of one predictor on Y changes based on the other's value, showing interactions between them. The difference between the predictions is that without the interaction, the model assumes that each predictor affects the outcome independently. The combined effect is simply the sum of individual contributions. Which means, that the impact of one variable on the outcome does not change based on the level of another variable. With the interaction, the model acknowledges that the effect of one predictor on the outcome can depend on the level of anothe predictor. This means the model captures how variables work together, showing relationships where the combined effect of predictors can be greater or less than the sum of their independent effects. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. To update and use the two implied formulas for predicting the outcome when consdering binary variables for \"high\" low\" advertissment budgets, we modify the multiple linear regression models to incllude binary representations and interaction terms. I already explained how the two equations change in the previous question, so now we have to wonder how to use these models for predictions. For the additive model, plug in the binary values for X1 and X2 (0 to 1), to make a prediction. The prediction will be the sum of the baseline B0, the effect of high TV advertising B1 if applicable, and the effect of high pnline adversiting B2 if applicable. For the interactive model where we include the interaction model, if both variables are 1. The interaction effect of high spending on both is just the sume of their individual effects. "

    "### The contradiction between the low R-squared value and the significant coefficients can be explained by understanding how regression models work with complexity and interactions. Firstly, the low R-squared value of 17.6% inidicates that model dosen't acocount for much of the toal variability of the dataset. What this means is that, the current set of predictors (Sp. Def and Generation) is not fully accounting for all the factors that are having an effect on HP, which by result leaves a huge amount of the variation unexplained. However, the significant coefficiants (with large and low p-values) are indicating that these variables listed above are indeed having a strong effect on Hp. The evideence-based model building technique suggests that these variable do statsitically have an effect on Hp, even though they don't fully account for its variation. These type of situations are uncommon, but are possible when the predictors are relevant to the variables, but they only capture a small portion of the influences on the response variable. There are several conclusions that you could take away from this, one being that it's possible that there are missing predictors or complex interactions between variables that aren't found in the model, leading to the low R-squared value."

    "## From model3_fit to model5_linear_form:\n",
    "### Rationale: model3_fit uses basic and not-so-hard to understand predictor variables (attack and defense) to predict Hp. On the contrary, to improve this, model5_linear_form extends this list of variables by adding (speed, Sp. Def, Sp. Atk) and a few categorical indicators (Legendary, Generation, Type 1, and Type 2). This new \"evolution\" of model3_fit to model5_linear_form follows the idealogy of expanding the model to include a wider variety of significant and cateogiral distinctions, in order to be able to analyze a more comprehensive demonstration of the factors affecting HP. \n",
    "\n",
    "## From model5_linear_form to Model6_linear_form:\n",
    "### While model5_linear_form would demonstrate a wide variety of predictors, you would normally assume that that is what we aim to get, but if you look closer you'll notice that there are a select few variables that do not have significant efects. Therefore, model6_linear_form aims to narrow down the predictors to only include the impactful and meaningful variables such as specific Type 1 categories and Generation indicators. This development is based on modifying the model to include variables that demonstrate important to the analysis, by importance, we mean variable which are the most influencial. \n",
    "\n",
    "## From model6_linear_form to model7_linear_form:\n",
    "### Model7_linear_form develops model6_linear_form further by adding interaction terms to along with the continuous predictors. This change aims to capture the complicated relationships between predictors where it aims to help us better understand and analyze where the effect of one predictor depnds on another. The goal of this is to explore potential synergistic effects among variables (situations where the combined impact of two or more variables on an outcome is greater than the sum of their individual effects). Which enhaneces the model's ability to represent real-world complexitites in how attributes influence HP."

    "### the illustration is showing how well a regression model can predict the Hp of PokÃ©mon from a variety of generations purely based on their characteristics such as Attack or Speed, as well as other attributes. The different models use different characteristics as test data and then use that data to test on other generations to see if they generalize well. This is completed to test out wether the relationships between PokÃ©mon stats remain the same throughout different groups or if they are specific to one group. The most important thing to understand from these models is that the code is designed to evaluate \"in-sample\" (test data) and \"out of sample\" (new data) R-squared values. By doing so, we're able to analyze wether the models are good at predicting new data or if it's only good at predicting data that it was tested on. Furthermore, an immense difference between the test data and new data R-squared indicates overfitting, which means that the model is not accurately generalizing well to new PokÃ©mon. In addition, the models inlcude indicator variables for types and generations and use centering and scaling to avoid multicollinearity, which can affect the model's ability to identify true relationships."
